# DMS Safe Bot (Mock)

A safe demo multi-language chatbot panel with a password-protected pairing page.
This does **NOT** connect to WhatsApp. It uses a mock backend so you can deploy for free,
preview the flow, and later switch to an official provider (Meta WhatsApp Cloud API, Twilio, etc.).

## Quick Start (Mock)
1. `npm install`
2. `cp .env.example .env` (edit if you want)
3. `npm start`
4. Open `http://localhost:8080` (or your host URL)

Password for pairing: `Sazzy`
